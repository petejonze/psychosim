# psychosim: MATLAB code for simulating simple psychophysical experiments

Simple code for simulating psychophysical experiments. Originally uploaded as Supplemental Material for Jones (in press) A note on detecting statistical outliers in psychophysical data, <i>Attention, Perception & Psychophysics</i>, in press.

### Quick Start: Setting up
1. Download the Zip archive and unzip it into an appropriate directory
2. Run outlierExclusionSim_v1_0_0.m in MATLAB

### System Requirements
**Operating system:**
QuestPlus is pure MATLAB code, and should function on all operating systems in which MATLAB is supported.

**Programming language:**
QuestPlus requires MATLAB V2012 or later. Due to the use of modern OOP syntax, QuestPlus is not compatible with earlier versions of MATLAB, or with Octave.

**Dependencies:**
There are several MATLAB toolbox dependencies. See outlierExclusionSim_v1_0_0.m for details.
